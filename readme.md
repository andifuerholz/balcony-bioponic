## Project description

## Hardware

The bioponics system is built from a set of components aiming for a balcony-scale food production. The hardware includes:

- **Two cultivation channels**, each equipped with six holes for net pots used to grow lettuces and other leafy greens.
- **Two planting containers** for larger crops such as tomatoes or chayote.
- **One 15l water tank** containing the nutrient solution.
- **A Biofilter** with cocos a clay balls which creates and maintains the microbial colonies needed to break down organic fertilizers so that nutrients become continuously available to the plants.
- **One water pump** responsible for circulating the nutrient solution through the system.
- **Two water control valves** to regulate flow distribution between the cultivation channels and the planting containers.
- **One air pump** which supplies oxygen to keep the microbial communities active so they can efficiently break down organic nutrients
- **One Arduino Nano ESP32**, serving as the central microcontroller for automation and pump control.
- **Additional electronic components**, including relays, voltage converters, a power supply, and supporting circuitry.
- **One outdoor temperature sensor (DS18B20)** to measure ambient temperature.
- **One water temperature sensor (DS18B20)** to monitor the nutrient solution temperature.
- **A custom-built water level sensing system**, consisting of six reed switches positioned at different heights.
- **An auxiliary tank with its own pump** to refill or stabilize the main reservoir when required.

## Software
### Core Watering Logic

The software controls the watering cycles within a defined daily time window (e.g., from 09:00 to 21:00).  
Within this active period, the pump of each watering circuit is triggered according to a schedule that specifies **at which minutes of the hour** the pump should run.

The configuration is independent for:

- the two watering circuits
- different ranges of outdoor temperature

Example:

If the outdoor temperature is **26 °C**, then at minutes **0, 20, and 40** of each hour, the pump of **circuit 1** is activated for **10 seconds**.

This logic allows the system to adapt its watering frequency to the current temperature conditions.

### Framework description

The software running on the Arduino Nano ESP32 is based on MicroPython.  
The system uses several components, libraries and external services:

- **MicroPython firmware on the ESP32**, installed using the  
  [Arduino MicroPython Installer](https://labs.arduino.cc/en/labs/micropython-installer)

- **Arduino Cloud**, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and interaction.

- **Arduino IoT Cloud Python Library**, used to communicate with the Arduino Cloud:  
  https://github.com/arduino/arduino-iot-cloud-py

- A detailed setup guide and example for connecting the ESP32 with MicroPython to Arduino IoT Cloud is available here:
